# clash-of-clans-stats
Web app and REST API to gather Clash of Clans statistics

## What?
A simple web app that shows historical information of your clan's wars. Mostly focused on per-member statistics like "attacks % and # of stars on the last 10 wars".
It will also expose the same information through a simple REST API.

## Why?
Keeping track of clans and members performance is a tough task.

## How?
It uses the [Clash of Clans API](https://developer.clashofclans.com), which although it's very basic, is still useful for this.
